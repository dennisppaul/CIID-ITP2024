#### NERD_WISDOM

- DON'T PANIC
- press `CMD+T` + `CMD+S` before you run `CMD+R` your code
- give descriptive names to *variables* and *functions+methods*
- if daniel shiffman didn't make a video about it is not part of processing/p5.js
- buy a rubber duck
- if you can write down a recipe, you can program
- clean up your code every once in a while ( aka *refactoring* )
- use *functions+methods* to *chop up* your code into structural sections with specific functionality ( i.e good naming replaces excessive comments )
- there is no bad coding style as long as there IS a coding style
- always start counting at `0`
- use pen&paper for thinking outside your head
- trust the process
- build, test, repeat
- `23 < 43`
- `RTFM` or `RTFC` ( `C` as in *console* ) both are your friends
- don’t play games, make games ( see [Videogames on Programming](https://www.notion.so/Videogames-on-Programming-30cfa09e4e9246e49bec4bf131442ec4) )
- all *developer colors* are beautiful … especially when combined ( e.g (255,0,0) + (0,255,0) )
- DON'T PANIC
